# New fun environment to enjoy Reinforcement Learning

New ! 
I created a new environment where you can use RL algorithms. 

I made this environnement for engineers and searchers. 
This environnement is based on Blob :

A player (first Blob) must eat the food (second blob). But he must avoid to come across on the enemy (third blob). 

This environnement can be found in ```Env_wPygame.py```. 

**Easy to use** : 
You instantiate 3 times the Blob class (One instantiation for each blob). 
And you use Pygame to render the environnement.

## Only a few easy prerequisites
You need : 
* Python 3.7 (or a newer version)
* Pygame
* Numpy

## Demo
Run ```render_env.py``` (be sure to keep all the scripts of this repo in the same folder).

**What you need to run this demo** :
* Python 3.7 (or a newer version)
* Pygame (1.9.6 or a newer version)
* Numpy (1.19.5, but another version should work)
* Matplotlib (3.3.3, but another version should work)
